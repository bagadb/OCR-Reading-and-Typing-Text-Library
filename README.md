# OCR-Reading-and-Typing-Text-Library
This started out as a Typeracer script , now I've made it into a class.

I plan to add more functions for pre-processing images for better accuracy.

You can spin up a Typeracer cheat using existing functions, Might do i myself someday too :p

Requirements:
  
  - python 2.7
  - Tesseract
  - pytesseract
  - pyautogui
  - pynput
  - PIL or Pillow
  
This is not a final version.
